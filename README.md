# PRODIGY_DS_02
This repository contains Task_02 of the Data Science Internship under Prodigy InfoTech. In this task I worked with Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset. I cleaned the data by fixing or removing empty and wrong values. I also performed exploratory data analysis on Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset from Kaggle. I made different graphs to understand the relationships between the variables like the number of Movies and TV Shows, release years, movie durations and the connection between release year and duration. This helped me to find patterns and trends in the data easily.
